# My first Apex repository

This repository was created as part of my studies using the book Salesforce Apex by Eduardo Carvalho.
Some classes in this repository are direct copies from the book, while others were  created by me following research and findings from online sources.

## Classes developed by me

* **AcessModifiersTraining** - This class explain how we can use the access modifiers public, protected, private and default in Salesforce Apex
* **ApexCollections** - This class illustrates some native functions of collections in Apex
